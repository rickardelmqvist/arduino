# ARDUINO PLAYGROUND
Playground for Arduino micro-controller and my learning projects towards the reason I bought it in the first place.

## PROJECT: arduino_uno_hex_diods
First trial project.  
Small program that counts 0 - 15 using four diods on port 13,12,11,10.

## PROJECT: arduino_uno_pushbutton_and_diods
Second trial project.  
Small program that reads input state (port 2) of a push button (port 3) and if pressed, unlights blue LED and blinks two red LED:s (ports 4,5) for as long as it is pressed.

## PROJECT: arduino_uno_temp_meter
Third trial project.  
Investigates usage of a 1024 resolution analogue temp sensor to measure skin temperature in comparison to a base temperature.
